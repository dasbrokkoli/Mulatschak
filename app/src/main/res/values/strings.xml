        ## Cards \n
        At Mulatschak there are a total of 33 cards and 4 different suits \n
        * Hearts \n
        * Leaves \n
        * Acorns \n
        * Bells \n
        For each suit there are eight cards. These include the number cards 7 - 10, Ober, Unter, King, Ace \n.
        Then there is the Weli. The Weli is not assigned to any suit and is the second highest card after the Ace. \n
        ## Tricks and values \n
        As in Schnapsen, the highest card in the round is the trick and the player who plays this card receives a point.
        \n
        The cards have the following values (regardless of suit). A higher card automatically trumps all lower cards,
        unless it is itself trumped by a higher card: \n
        7 &lt; 8 &lt; 9 &lt; 10 &lt; 11 &lt; Ober &lt; Unter &lt; King &lt; Weli &lt; Ace \n
        It should be noted that the atout suit has the very highest value and beats everything. This means that a card
        played that matches the atout suit cannot be beaten by a higher card unless it also matches the atout suit. \n
        ## Atout and trick announcement \n
        After the cards are dealt, the players make trick announcements. A trick announcement is an estimate of how many
        tricks are likely to be made in that round. Each trick announcement MUST be achieved, otherwise points are
        written down again. \n
        The player who makes the highest trick announcement gets to announce the atout. \n
        The atout corresponds to one of the four suits (hearts, leaves, acorns, bells) and is determined each round.
        Cards with the atout suit always have a higher value than cards with a different suit and can only be played by
        higher cards which themselves correspond to the atout suit. \n
        ## Deal and draw cards \n
        After the turn, it is each player\'s turn to deal. The left/right neighbor may draw the weli. To do this, he
        takes the pile of cards, divides it and looks to see if the card in the middle is the Weli. If it is the Weli,
        he shows the Weli to the other players and may keep it. If it is not the Weli, but another card, it is shuffled
        again among the cards. \n
        ## How to play \n
        The player who announced the atout may play the first card. After each player has played a card (played card
        must be higher than previously played card), the player with the highest card (see **tricks and values**) wins
        and may start the next round. \n
        ## Special atout rules: \n
        Hearts: the points made count double \n
        Bells: no player can drop out of the round \n
